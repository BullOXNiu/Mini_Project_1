                        This visualizations is a good visualization of the tallest buildings on every continent. The audience is anybody interested in tall buildings and the comparisons between them around the world. The reader does not require any prior experience with data visualizations to be able to read and understand this example. 
                        The visualization introduces the questions of where are the tallest buildings, how tall are they, when were they built, and how do they compare to each other. The location of the buildings is indicated on the map while the depictions of the buildings below the map give more information about the exact location, height, year of build, and name of the building.  
		                The data encoded is quantitative data of the height of the buildings, as well as categorical data of which continent they are located in. 
                        <br>
		                The readers are able to identify the extremes and compare the values of the height of the buildings around the world. It is easy to see which continent has the tallest buildings and which the lowest, but the reader can not identify any trend in the distribution of the tallest buildings
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <b>Functional- </b>The goal of this visualization is to show the locations and height of the tallest buildings for each continent. This visualizations achieves this goal in a clear and comprehensive way. As the location is evidently shown on the map, and the height of the buildings on the comparison below the map, the visualization appears to be functional. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Beautiful- </b>It is beautiful in a way that it shows the data with interesting designs. Instead of having a bar chart to compare the height of the buildings, they are using small depictions that make it more esthetically pleasing without over doing it. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Insightful- </b>The data provides insightful information about the data depicted. A reader can easily extract the most important/tallest buildings for each continent. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Enlightening— </b>The categorization of the buildings according to continent provides more enlightening conclusions to the readers. We can clearly see the differences across the continents instead of just the height difference. For example, it is evident that Africa has way shorter buildings than any other continent
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Following the five principles, as well as all other aspects of this visualization, it appears to be doing an excellent job. It is a good visualization, beautiful, insightful, and comprehensive by an average reader.

                        <br>
                        This visualizations is illustrating the increase or decrease in the average % change in weekly cases for countries around the world. 

                        The audience is the whole population, as the Coronavirus pandemic affects everybody. 

                        The visualizations is trying to convey the intensity of the cases for each country depicted. It is raising the questions of which countries are doing better or worse. This question is answered partly. It is clear which countries are experiencing an increase in weekly cases and which ones a decrease but among the increasing countries it is hard to see which are doing the best. The colors indicate that, but the circle can be confusing. The radius of the circle represents the percentage increase or decrease, but when a reader first sees the graph, he or she might get confused with the slope. The countries are organized alphabetically, so the ones in the beginning of the alphabet have a steeper slope, which looks like a greater increase, but that is not the case. 

                        The data encoded is quantitative, the percentage increase or decreased in weekly cases per country.

                        <br>
                        The readers can easily identify the extremes, once they have comprehended the structure of the visualization. The longest the line, the greatest the increase or decrease. However, it is difficult to make comparisons between countries, as some lines overlap with each other making it hard to distinguish the different countries.

                        <b>Truthful- </b>The data indicates clearly the increase or decrease in the cases, but as it is confusing to identify the extent of that increase the visualization is not absolutely truthful. The ambiguity with the slope of the lines and the length, about which one represents the % change, could be misinterpreted.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Functional- </b>As the different lines overlap in some countries, it is hard to distinguish them making the visualization less functional. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Beautiful- </b>The visualizations is actually very impressive and beautiful. The half-circle shape is innovative and the colors help with the distinction between an increase and a decrease in average weekly cases. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Insightful- </b>The visualization is insightful for the reader that has understood its structure. He or she can identify the countries with a tremendous increase or decrease in cases and the colors also help with that task. However, it could be confusing for some other readers. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Enlightening— </b>The ambiguity of this visualizations makes it difficult to decipher the message its trying to convey to the readers. So, it is not enlightening.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Based on these five criteria, this visualization is beautiful and functional for readers with some prior experience with data visualization, but it can be confusing for the rest.

                        The audience is the same as the original design, everybody. The main purpose of this visualization is to show which countries are experiencing increases or decreases in the average weekly cases. 

                        The data encoded is again the % change of cases for each country, however the increase or decrease is represented with a bar instead of a line. 

                        <br>
                        The redesign allows the reader to identify the extremes more easily than the original design and it also allows comparisons. Contrary to the original design the redesign is sorted in a decreasing order making comparisons more clear. The vertical axis is the average %change of cases, and the bars above the horizontal line represent the countries that have experienced increases in cases, while the bars below the horizontal line represent the ones that have decreasing number of cases.

                        <b>Truthful- </b>The redesign is truthful, as the values of the increase or decrease are clear on the vertical axis, and the bars are clearly distinguished. Compared the the lines on the original design that overlap. 

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Functional- </b>The visualization is functional. It achieves the goal of informing people about the changes in coronavirus cases effectively. The redesign is simple but straightforward.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Beautiful- </b>The sorted bars, and the gradient colors make the redesign beautiful and more organized than the original design. However, it is way more simplistic than the original design. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Insightful- </b>The visualization gives insight on the data that is depicted very effectively. Each country’s increase or decrease is clearly indicted, both by the color and the height of the bar.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Enlightening- </b>The reader viewing this design can clearly see the progress of each country. It is in a way enlightening, but as the data for total cases is not included in the visualization there is room for improvement.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        According to those principles, the design is relatively good. It might appear to be very simplistic, but as the data is not complicated, more sophisticated design might not be effective in conveying the message of the visualization. The redesign is more efficient than the original design for that exact reason. A more simplistic visualization is better n this case.
