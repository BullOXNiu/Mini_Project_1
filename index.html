                        The audience who would look at this graph is probably people who have interests in learning about online gaming and the general information and statistics of this now multi-billion-dollar industry. The visualization does more than just showing data as it goes into details about presenting the history of the industry, highlighting events that shifted the landscape, the major contributors, the current environment consisted of PC, Console and Mobile gaming, and a look at the future development. Of course, besides using words, many claims and facts are backed up by real data in the forms like bar chart, pie chart and stacked bar chart. These types of visualizations are great for comparisons, whether it is between sub-categories or the same variables across time, which would, along with the use color coding, provide the necessary information that a reader can easily pick up such as the extremes of trends. In terms of the five principles, this graph satisfies all of them: It does not hide or alter data and credits all sources, all the graphs within use the most effective design to achieve the main purpose, the entire visualization is clean and everything is spaced out, the accompanying words explain the graphs and data in detail and highlight the facts that we should understand and after reading the infographic, we will essentially finish a crash course on the online gaming industry knowing its past, present and future, which can inspire different conversations and further research.

                        This visualization is a good visualization of the tallest buildings on every continent. The audience is anybody interested in tall buildings and the comparisons between them around the world. The reader does not require any prior experience with data visualizations to be able to read and understand this example. 
                        The visualization introduces the questions of where are the tallest buildings, how tall are they, when were they built, and how do they compare to each other. The location of the buildings is indicated on the map while the depictions of the buildings below the map give more information about the exact location, height, year of build, and name of the building.  
                        The data encoded is quantitative data of the height of the buildings, as well as categorical data of which continent they are located in. 
                        The readers are able to identify the extremes and compare the values of the height of the buildings around the world. It is easy to see which continent has the tallest buildings and which the lowest, but the reader can not identify any trend in the distribution of the tallest buildings

                        Functional — The goal of this visualization is to show the locations and height of the tallest buildings for each continent. This visualization achieves this goal in a clear and comprehensive way. As the location is evidently shown on the map, and the height of the buildings on the comparison below the map, the visualization appears to be functional. 
                        Beautiful— It is beautiful in a way that it shows the data with interesting designs. Instead of having a bar chart to compare the height of the buildings, they are using small depictions that make it more esthetically pleasing without overdoing it. 
                        Insightful — The data provides insightful information about the data depicted. A reader can easily extract the most important/tallest buildings for each continent. 
                        Enlightening— The categorization of the buildings according to continent provides more enlightening conclusions to the readers. We can clearly see the differences across the continents instead of just the height difference. For example, it is evident that Africa has way shorter buildings than any other continent

                        Following the five principles, as well as all other aspects of this visualization, it appears to be doing an excellent job. It is a good visualization, beautiful, insightful, and comprehensive by an average reader.

                        This is not a typical data visualization, nor is this a typical blog for typical people. Having stumbled across this blog post, I would say that its audience is mostly towards cs engineers, due to the extensive coding and math incorporated. The visualizations here, as I should point out, are all computer generated after the user uploads a photo of banana and bread slices. The ensuing visualization conveniently answers the question of how to optimally cover a slice of bread with banana slices without skips (skipping a slice). Each slice of banana is designated a unique color and number that increases by one for each slice cut. The user actually interacts with the data itself, for the user is responsible for taking and uploading the original photo of a bread slice with the whole banana. After retrieving the optimal coverage visualization from the python program, the user then proceeds to cut the banana into slices as shown by the diagram to achieve maximum coverage! With regards to the five principles of visualization, this program comfortably achieves all: The program doesn’t distort the image of banana or bread, nor does it produce falsified information; It is highly functional, as it solves a commonplace mystery of optimal banana slices placement in a sandwich; The colored layer is also beautifully drawn(generated) to distinguish different banana slices; It is self explanatory that this is an insightful visualization, since who else would’ve gone this far into one of the most routine breakfast tasks; The science behind this program is also deeply enlightening to those interested, as it referenced topics such as “Rad Coordinate Transformations”, “Ellipsoidal Assumptions”, etc.. It is difficult to judge this visualization, for there is simply NOTHING like this at all! Since good is only meaningful when there is a bad to counter it, in the absence of a second banana bread diagram, I give this one the benefit of doubt and declare it a good visualization.
